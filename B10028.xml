            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Short Account of a Second Engagement, That happened on <hi>Monday</hi> Night and <hi>Tuesday</hi> Morning, between the King and Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> Army near WINDSOR: With the King's withdrawing from <hi>White-Hall;</hi> and the Burning of the Popish Mass-Houses; as also the Surrender of the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WE Promis'd in our Last, a fuller Account of the Engagement at <hi>Reading;</hi> but there happen'd since a deeper Skirmish between the same Forces, and other surprizal Accidents since of greater Consequence, obliges us for the Publick Satisfaction, to give a further Account of the present Occurrences.</p>
            <p>The King's Forces at <hi>Reading,</hi> for the smallness of their Number, being wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted; The Prince's Army, without any considerable Resistance, made their gradual Approaches towards <hi>Windsor,</hi> where some Regiments of the King's being Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, went out in Battalia to Oppose them. The Fight began in the Evening, which continued all Night, with fierce Skirmishes, manag'd with all the Art and Stratagems that Experience or Courage cou'd direct. In the Morning, coming to a resolute Re-encounter, when the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> prevailing, got an absolute Conquest. This sudden Defeat, with Horror and Consternation, drew the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of the Vanquish'd Forces towards <hi>London,</hi> as their last Sanctuary. But the consequence is as deplorable, when coming to Town, they were Disbanded by their Officers, as were several other Regiments the same day.</p>
            <p>The King having notice of this Defeat, withdrew from Court, with a few Nobles, on <hi>Tuesday</hi> Morning, about Two a Clock; the Queen and Young Prince being gone the day before.</p>
            <p>The consequence of this, was as Deplorable as His Majesty's Absenting, when the Commonalty taking advantage of this Opportunity, did what seem'd good in their own Eyes; and the same Night, they gathering into Multitudes in several parts of the City, made great Bone-fires, by pulling down the <hi>Popish</hi> Mass-Houses, <hi>viz.</hi> That of St. <hi>Jones</hi>'s, <hi>Lincolus-Inn-Fields, Lime-street,</hi> &amp;c. Burning their Foppish Trumpery in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and in other open places convenient for that purpose.</p>
            <p>The same day the Lord Mayor, sitting in Council, order'd the Government of the <hi>Tower</hi> into the Hands of the City.</p>
            <p>The Prince, without Resistance, is now Marching towards the City, with his Intire Body. There being this day Arriv'd here some Officers Commissioners from His Highness, to assign Quarters for his Van-Guard, whose Orders are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually performed, and Quarters already Taken in <hi>Holbourn</hi> and else-where; they being expected in Town to Morrow, and the Prince on <hi>Thursday.</hi>
